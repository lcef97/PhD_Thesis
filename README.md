#### Literally just my PhD thesis.
Works ongoing, must finish by the end of 2025, hopefully.
Nothing stunning to see here, this is just the easiest way I've thought of so far to share my -ongoing- PhD thesis. 
Let us make it crystal clear: I don't think there is anything worthy being read by the public. 
But this may be useful for, say, any exchange of ideas with my beloved colleagues.
